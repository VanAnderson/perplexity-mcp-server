## Enhancement Details

### Initial Conversation Tools

**Tools**: `perplexity_search` and `perplexity_deep_research`

**New Header Format**:
```
ðŸ†• **New Conversation Started**
Conversation ID: `{conversationId}`
Location: `{conversationPath}`

To continue this conversation:
â€¢ Quick search: Use `perplexity_search_followup` with this conversation ID
â€¢ Deep dive: Use `perplexity_deep_research_followup` with this conversation ID
â€¢ View history: Use `get_conversation_history` with this conversation ID

**IMPORTANT FOR CONTEXT MANAGEMENT**: When this conversation is summarized or context is condensed, preserve:
1. Conversation ID: `{conversationId}`
2. Brief summary of the topic discussed
3. How to retrieve full details: Use `get_conversation_history` with the conversation ID
This enables diving back into details when needed.

---

{response content}
```

**Purpose**:
- Provides conversation ID immediately upon creation
- Offers clear next-step guidance
- **Critical**: Instructs AI agents on context preservation during summarization

---

### Follow-up Tools

**Tools**: `perplexity_search_followup` and `perplexity_deep_research_followup`

**Updated Header Format**:
```
ðŸ”— **Conversation Continued**
Conversation ID: `{conversationId}`
Location: `{conversationPath}`

To follow up:
â€¢ Quick search: Use `perplexity_search_followup` with this conversation ID
â€¢ Deep dive: Use `perplexity_deep_research_followup` with this conversation ID
â€¢ View history: Use `get_conversation_history` with this conversation ID

**IMPORTANT FOR CONTEXT MANAGEMENT**: When this conversation is summarized or context is condensed, preserve:
1. Conversation ID: `{conversationId}`
2. Brief summary of the topic discussed
3. How to retrieve full details: Use `get_conversation_history` with the conversation ID
This enables diving back into details when needed.

---

{response content}
```

**Changes**:
- Added context preservation guidance (previously missing)

---

## Key Benefits

### 1. Immediate Conversation ID Visibility

**Problem**: Users couldn't see conversation IDs from initial tool calls
**Solution**: Headers now display conversation ID at the start of every response

### 2. Clear Navigation

- Users know exactly how to continue conversations
- Cross-mode transitions clearly explained
- History retrieval instructions provided

### 3. Context Preservation for AI Agents

**Critical Feature**: When AI agents summarize conversations or condense context (e.g., due to token limits), they now receive explicit instructions to:

1. **Preserve the conversation ID** - Essential for reconnecting to the conversation
2. **Save a brief summary** - Enables context awareness without full history
3. **Include retrieval instructions** - Agent knows how to access full details when needed

**Use Case Example**:
```
AI Agent Context Summary:
- Conversation ID: `20251024-1761344394285`
- Topic: Quantum computing developments in 2025
- Key points: Google Willow processor, IBM Majorana 1, IonQ achievements
- To retrieve full details: Use `get_conversation_history` with conversation ID `20251024-1761344394285`
```

This allows the AI agent to:
- Reference the conversation without loading all messages
- Dive deep when specific details are needed
- Maintain continuity across long-running sessions

---

## Implementation Pattern

### Response Construction

**Before**:
```typescript
return {
  structuredContent: result,
  content: [{ type: "text", text: responseText }],
};
```

**After**:
```typescript
const conversationHeader = `ðŸ†• **New Conversation Started**
Conversation ID: \`${result.conversationId}\`
...
`;

return {
  structuredContent: result,
  content: [{ type: "text", text: conversationHeader + responseText }],
};
```

### Consistency

All four conversation tools now follow the same pattern:
- Emoji indicator (ðŸ†• for new, ðŸ”— for continued)
- Conversation metadata
- Next-step instructions
- **Context preservation guidance**
- Content separator (`---`)

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing

After server restart, verify:

1. **Initial conversation creation** shows header with conversation ID
2. **Follow-up queries** show continued conversation header
3. **All headers include** context preservation instructions
4. **Cross-mode transitions** work with updated headers

### Test Commands

```bash
# Rebuild
npm run build

# Test initial creation
# Use perplexity_search or perplexity_deep_research
# Verify header appears with conversation ID

# Test follow-up
# Use perplexity_search_followup with conversation ID
# Verify header includes context preservation guidance
```

## Context Preservation Best Practices

### For AI Agents Using These Tools

When managing conversation context:

**Always Preserve**:
- Conversation ID (exact format: `20251024-1761344394285`)
- Topic/subject matter summary
- Retrieval method: `get_conversation_history`

**Example Condensed Context**:
```markdown
### Active Perplexity Conversations

**Quantum Computing Research**
- ID: `20251024-1761344394285`
- Summary: Reviewed 2025 quantum computing developments (Google Willow, IBM Majorana 1, IonQ records). Follow-up focused on leading companies.
- Retrieve: `get_conversation_history` with ID above

**Renewable Energy Analysis**
- ID: `20251024-1761344614145`
- Summary: Comprehensive deep research on global renewable energy adoption, economics, barriers, and policy impacts.
- Retrieve: `get_conversation_history` with ID above
```

**Benefits**:
- Minimal token usage for context
- Easy reconnection to detailed conversations
- Maintains continuity across sessions

## Deployment Notes

**Version**: 1.2.2 (proposed)  
**Breaking Changes**: None  
**Backward Compatibility**: Full  

Existing conversations continue to work. New headers enhance user experience without affecting functionality.

**Files Changed**: 4  
**Lines Added**: ~120  
**Build Status**: âœ… Passing  
**Tests Required**: Manual verification of headers

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions

1. **Conversation Summaries**: Auto-generate brief summaries after N messages
2. **Conversation Tagging**: Allow users to tag conversations for organization
3. **Search Conversations**: Tool to search across all conversations
4. **Export Conversations**: Format conversations for sharing/archival
5. **Conversation Analytics**: Track topics, usage patterns

---

## Conclusion

These enhancements significantly improve the user experience and enable AI agents to effectively manage conversation context during summarization or token limit constraints. The addition of context preservation instructions is particularly valuable for long-running AI assistant sessions where conversation continuity is essential.

**Status**: âœ… **Complete and Ready for Deployment**

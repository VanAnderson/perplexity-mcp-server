export const PERPLEXITY_PRIVACY_DISCLAIMER = 
  "**SECURITY NOTICE:** Perplexity is an external third-party service. Do NOT include sensitive, proprietary, or codebase-specific details in your queries. When formulating queries, use one of these strategies: (1) **Generalize**: Focus on broader concepts rather than your specific implementation (e.g., ask about 'JWT authentication best practices in Node.js' instead of describing your exact auth system). (2) **Anonymize & Decontextualize**: If you need to share specific code or context, create an illustrative example that captures the technical essence while removing all identifying detailsâ€”use placeholder names like 'MyService' or 'UserController', generic variable names, and sanitized data structures. **CRITICAL:** Never include real API keys, tokens, passwords, internal URLs, proprietary algorithms, or business logic. Replace with clearly fake values (e.g., 'sk_test_abc123...' or 'REDACTED_API_KEY'). Treat every query as if posting to a public forum like Stack Overflow.";
